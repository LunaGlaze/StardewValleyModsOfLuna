The good news is, they claim to have learned from it and decided to minimize interference in a new way...^^Anyway, long story short, I heard they’re launching a new ‘local vendor’ strategy from another manager. I don’t really get it, but it basically means they’re having townsfolk like us sell some of their products.^^I figured you might find it useful, so I agreed to carry the Auto-Petter. It’s definitely pricier than buying from JojaMart, though.^^Come check it out!^^ —Marnie",
